    "- Option 1: Break your Code cell into multiple Code cells and place only one command in each cell so that you can display output of each command.\n",
    "- Option 2: (**Preferred**) In a Code cell, put print() statements around each Python command whose output you would like to display."

As its name implies, the BRFSS is designed to identify risk factors in the adult population and report emerging health trends. For example, respondents are asked about their diet and weekly physical activity, their HIV/AIDS status, possible tobacco use, and even their level of healthcare coverage.\n",
